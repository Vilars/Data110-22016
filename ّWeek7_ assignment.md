# Focused Iris Data Analysis Assignment

## Objective
In this assignment, you will perform specific data visualization and analysis tasks on the Iris dataset similar to what we did in week 7 related to Penguins Dataset 
## Dataset
You will be working with the 'Iris' dataset, which is available in the seaborn library. This dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Visualization 

#### 1.1 Pair Plot 
Create a pair plot of all features in the Iris dataset, color-coding by species. Include an overall title for the plot.

#### 1.2 Bar Plot 
Create a bar plot showing the average sepal length for each iris species.

#### 1.3 Box Plot 
Create a box plot showing the distribution of petal widths for each species.

#### 1.4 Grouped Bar Plot 
Create a grouped bar plot showing the average sepal and petal lengths by species.

#### 1.5 Violin Plot 
Create a violin plot showing the distribution of sepal length for each species.

### 2. Data Analysis 

#### 2.1 Aggregation 
a) Calculate and display the mean, minimum, and maximum values of all numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for each species.
b) Count and display the number of samples in each species.

#### 2.2 Interpretation 
Provide a brief interpretation (2-3 sentences) for each of the visualizations and the aggregated data. What insights can you draw about the different iris species based on these results?

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your work as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).
- Include comments explaining your code.
- Ensure all visualizations are properly labeled with titles, axis labels, and legends where appropriate.
- Include your interpretations in markdown cells following each visualization and analysis.

## Grading Criteria
- Correct implementation of required visualizations and analyses (70%)
- Code quality and comments 
- Interpretation of results
