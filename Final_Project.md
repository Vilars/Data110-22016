# Final Project: Data Storytelling Mastery

## Introduction

Welcome to your Final Project. In this project, you will showcase your ability to analyze and visualize data while narrating a compelling story from your findings. The goal is not just to create charts and graphs, but to weave a narrative that highlights the significance of your data insights. This is an opportunity to demonstrate the full range of skills youâ€™ve developed throughout the course.

## Objective

Your task is to select a dataset, perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and present your findings using a series of well-designed visualizations. The focus should be on uncovering meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Creativity, depth of analysis, and clarity of communication will be key to your success.

## Project Requirements

1. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Choose a dataset that aligns with your interests or from [Prof. Rachel Dataset Collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AMRfddeMwKRaNidOV87JP1iCVn_z-Uv_). Alternatively, you may select one from public sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or government databases.
   - Ensure the dataset is sufficiently complex and allows for advanced analysis and storytelling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct an in-depth EDA to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within your dataset.
   - Identify and focus on compelling trends or patterns that can form the basis of your story.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create at least **five visualizations** that effectively communicate your findings.
   - Use diverse types of visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, line charts, histograms, bar charts, treemaps, choropleth maps, or Sankey diagrams) to address different aspects of the data.
   - Each visualization must include clear labels, titles, and legends where appropriate, along with a caption that explains its significance.

4. **Final Report**:
   - Compile your findings in a detailed and well-organized report. The report should include:
     - An introduction to the dataset and the motivation for your choice.
     - A summary of your EDA process and key observations.
     - Detailed descriptions of each visualization, explaining the rationale for its design and the insights it provides.
     - A conclusion that synthesizes your findings, discusses their implications, and suggests avenues for further research.

5. **Presentation**:
   - Prepare a **7-minute presentation** summarizing your project. Include:
     - A concise overview of your dataset and objectives.
     - Key insights from your EDA and visualizations.
     - A clear narrative tying your findings together.
   - Create **no more than 8 slides** for the main content (excluding the title and conclusion slides).
   - Use any presentation software of your choice (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote). For a sleek and interactive experience, consider [Slides.com](https://slides.com/).

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit both your final report and presentation slides by the end of the course.
- Ensure all code used for data manipulation and visualization is well-documented and included in an appendix or a separate file.
- Submission formats: HTML, PDF, or Jupyter Notebook via GitHub, or as a shared Google Colab file.

# Final Project Rubric and Evaluation Criteria

## Rubric

### Evaluation Criteria

| Evaluation              | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Points Allotted |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Outstanding**         | Project was submitted on time. The dataset is appropriate and aligns with the project goals. The work is thorough, insightful, and well-organized. Visualizations are impactful, properly labeled, and include legends. Language is precise, and the report effectively communicates ideas. All requirements are addressed thoughtfully and completely.                                                                                     | 100             |
| **Proficient**          | The dataset is appropriate, and the work is focused. Visualizations effectively highlight important data, with proper labeling and legends. Language is clear, and the report communicates ideas to the audience. Most requirements are addressed, though one or two areas could be developed further.                                                                                                           | 80              |
| **Developing**          | The dataset is somewhat appropriate but may lack complexity. Visualizations are included but may lack focus or clarity. The report has some coherence but struggles to effectively communicate findings. Not all requirements are addressed, or some answers are incomplete.                                                                                              | 60              |
| **Insufficient**        | Project was not submitted on time or lacks focus. The dataset may be inappropriate or under-analyzed. Visualizations are missing or poorly developed. Language and organization impede understanding. Many requirements are not met.                                                                                                                         | 40              |
